# IOThrottle
This program/application is to create IO chaos for resiliency testing/validation. Detailed documentation will be provided shortly. Running the program(.class) or jar - will prompt you for the Read chaos or Write chaos or Both. 
If you give "Read" option, the program will create Read chaos on the OS running it.  
If you give "Write" option, the program will create Write chaos on the OS running it. 
If you give "Both(Read/Write)", the program will create Read & Write chaos on the OS. The impact could be devasting on machines with magnetic drives(HDD). Please monitor the IO chaos real time.
